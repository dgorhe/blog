I am a first year Data Science MS student at Columbia University. This is just my outlet for random things I want to research and write about. I have the following topics in mind for the near future:

- Governance and Lack Thereof
- Will Academic Linguistics Help Me Learn Russian?
- CO2 Priors and Scope
- Farmland vs Indoor Farming
- Self-Driving Forklifts: Why Aren't They Here?
- When Will Gas Stations Become Uneconomical?
