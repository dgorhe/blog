# Darvesh Gorhe's Personal Blog

Home for personal blog made with jekyll. This is just my way of keeping track of what I write with version control. If I write something and later retract it, someone could fork this repo and they would have a record of what I said and committed. Futhermore if there's code that I include for any of my blogs (e.g. R code or Python code for visualizations), it will be contained within this repo. More to come as I set this up.
