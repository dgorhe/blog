I'm a first year Data Science MS student at Columbia University. This is just my outlet for random things I want to research and write about. I have the following topics in mind for the near future:

- Governance and Lack Thereof
- Will Academic Linguistics Help Me Learn Russian?
- CO2 Priors and Scope
- Farmland vs Indoor Farming
- Self-Driving Forklifts: Why Aren't They Here?

A lot of these are not clean data science problems and I think many fall into the category of operations research. Also, a lot of this has to do with what I think are answerable questions based on publically available information. My personal career goal is to automate medicine, but a lot of health data is not available and it's often a low-hanging fruit for data science projects. That's not to say that healthcare questions will never merit a blog post, just that it's less likely. Please email me any healthcare datasets that you'd be willing to share.
